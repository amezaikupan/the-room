I'm TN.  
I'm studying to be a data scientist, a comic writer, and overall, a good problem solver.  

**Basic stuff about me:**  

- 50% of my happiness is determined by sleep. The other 20% comes from good food.  
- My current beautiful (-ly foolish) endeavor:  
    - Learning to observe (myself and my surroundings)  
    - Speed (of my mind) and to not fear  
    - How to relationship  
- Current battle (to be won): My fear of coding (and heavily technical things).  
- Asking around to find a way to imagine a better world.
