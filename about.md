title: About Me
---

I'm TN. 
I'm studying to be a data scientist, a comic writer and overall, a good problem solver.
Basic stuff about me:
- 50% of my happiness is determined by sleep. The other 20% comes from good food.
- My current beautiful (-ly foolish) endeavor: Learning to observe (my self and my surroundings); Speed (of my mind) and to not fear; How to relationship
- Current battle (to be won): My fear of coding (and heavily technical things);
- Asking around to find a way to imagine a better world

Keywords: 
- Art: Comic; Relationship comics 
- Technical: Data Science; Causal inference.
