title: My mentors
---

This is a list of people who has taught me much about anything and changed my understanding of the world. There are profoundly many people who would make the list but is forgotten by my 22 years old brain, but I wish the remember from now on. I want to remember that I change a lot, hopefully for the better, because I met other people and when their differences crash with mine, I see new things. 

So, this is a record of that fortune. Of the people who had changed me. (not in chronological order)

1. Ba mẹ: Thank you for giving me this life and teaching me the first things I know about the world. I know you're tried your best. 
2. Bà: Thank you for telling me the wonderful of giving without expecting return (Thi ân bất cần báo). And for rasing me.
3. Ông: Thank you teaching and giving me your love for maths.
4. Phương Phương: Thank you for showing me the art of being yourself. I totally steal some of your eagerness and respect for the truth. 
5. Thầy Thắng (ND): Thank you for showing me so many things of the natural world, and for teaching me about stillness and the art of acting with urgency, but not in haste (Khẩn trương nhưng không vội vã).
6. Thầy Phước (SHF): Thank you for telling me your stories. I'm trying to live my days like you too - for everyday is a new adventure (mỗi ngày là một cuộc vui) and a life is a long journey (cuộc đời chuyến đi dài). I think you have the coolest Facebook on the internet.
7. Chị Thư (SHF): Thank you for teaching me the joy of sales. It's remarkable how much endurance and focus you have. I really love when you're in your elements and tell stories. To me that's definately one of the best things in Stone Hill Farm.
8. Anh Đô (SHF): Thank you for being patient and answer my questions. I want to be a jack-of-all-trade like you too. At least know enough to fix a car. (then I will have to go back and learn basic physics :"))
9. Cô Phúc (SHF): Thank you for showing the value of slowness. And that old people (people my parent age) can have fun on a swing, play with puppies and wear strawberry shorts on their day off too.
10. William (SHF): Thank you for showing me that cultures are different and to be respected. I looked at tradition with more empathy now. The biggest thing I learned in SHF is about *the important of observing - observation* and you're the biggest example for me. Thank you for being such good observer.
11. Wei (SHF): Thank you for answering my question Uncle Wei. And for being funny (though only live). Being stern is cool too though.
12. Chị Emily (CLAG): Thank you for your kindness and attention. Your support means a lot to us. 
13. Chị Sa (GLAG): Thank you for giving us the opportunity to go to where you work. It means a lot to be able to see how the company works, and knowing we deserve to be there.
